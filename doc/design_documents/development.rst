Development
===========

The `cpp_cgns` repository is compatible with the development process described in `external/project_utils/doc/Git_workflow.md`. It uses git submodules to ease the joint development with other repositories compatible with this organization. TL;DR: configure the git repository with `cd external/project_utils/git && configure_top_level_repo.sh`.
